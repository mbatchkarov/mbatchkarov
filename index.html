I am a member of the Text Analysis Group at the University of Sussex. In
addition to pursuing a PhD under the supervision of <a
href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/davidw/">Dr David Weir</a>, I
occasionally work with industrial partners on problems in applied natural
language processing. Click <a href="research.html">here</a> for a list of
projects I have been involved in or <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/davidw/resources/MLCL.pdf">here</a> for a
summary of what the laboratory can offer to potential customers.

This website has been under construction for a while. I now try to update it
periodically, but I still have a large backlog of tasks to go through.
