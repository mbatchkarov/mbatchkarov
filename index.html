I am a member of the Text Analysis Group at the University of Sussex. I completed a PhD under the supervision of <a
href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/davidw/">Dr David Weir</a> in September 2015. I now work work with industrial partners on problems in applied natural
language processing. Click <a href="/research">here</a> for an (outdated) list of projects I have been involved in.

This website has been under construction for a while. I now try to update it periodically, but I still have a large backlog of tasks to go through.
