I am currently a data scientist at <a
href="http://www.skim.it">skim.it</a>. Prior to that, I was a member of the Text Analysis Group at the University of Sussex,  where I completed a PhD under the supervision of <a
href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/davidw/">Dr David Weir</a>. I also worked with industrial partners on problems in applied natural
language processing.  Click <a href="/research">here</a> for an (outdated) list of projects I have been involved in, or find me on <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mbatchkarov">LinkedIn</a>.

This website has been under construction for a while. I now try to update it periodically, but I still have a large backlog of tasks to go through.
