I am currently a data scientist and lead engineer at <a
href="http://www.skimtechnologies.com">Skim Technologies</a>. Prior to that, I worked on text analysis problems at  CASM Consulting LLP, the commercial arms of the Text Analysis Group at the University of Sussex.  I also completed a PhD there under the supervision of <a
href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Users/davidw/">Dr David Weir</a>.
