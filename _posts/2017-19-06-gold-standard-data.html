<p>This article is a draft of a talk I am giving at PyData Berlin in July 2017. It is intended for a non-technical audience, but I plan to expand it into a more technical piece soon<sup>TM</sup>.
</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>It is often said that rather than spending a month figuring out how to apply unsupervised learning to a problem domain, a data scientist should spend a week labeling data. However, the difficulty of annotating data is often underestimated. Gathering a sufficiently large collection of good-quality labeled data requires careful problem definition, quality control and multiple iterations. As a result, gathering enough data to build a high-accuracy supervised model can take much longer than one might expect. This post describes my experiences in labeling gold-standard data for natural language processing and the lessons learned along the way.</p>
<h3 id="case-study-1-word-embeddings">Case study 1: word embeddings</h3>
<p>Words  vectors have become popular in recent years as they can be built without supervision and can capture complex semantic relations well. For example, adding the vectors of <code>king</code> and <code>woman</code> and subtracting the vector of <code>man</code> yields a vector that is very close to that of <code>queen</code>.</p>
<p>Algorithms for training word vectors have been evaluated by correlating the &quot;similarity&quot; of word pairs, as predicted by a model, to those provided by a human judge. A typical data set consists of word pairs and a similarity score, e.g. <code>cat, dog, 80%</code> and <code>cat, purple, 21%</code>. A model is considered good if it assigns high scores to word pairs that are scored highly by a human. Let us consider what it takes to label such a data set and what can go wrong in the process.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Is the task clearly defined? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What exactly is word similarity? We all have an intuitive understanding, but a lot of corner cases are hard to pin down. What makes the words <code>cat</code> and <code>dog</code> similar? Is it because they are both animals? What about topically related words, such as <code>rice</code> and <code>cooking</code>? What about antonyms, e.g. <code>big</code> and <code>small</code>? Human annotators need clear and unambiguous description of what is required of them, otherwise data quality will be
	poor. For instance, the similarity scores provided by 13 annotators for the pair <code>tigerâ€“cat</code> range from <code>50%</code> to <code>90%</code> in WordSim353, a data set often used to rank word similarity. Click <a href="http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/62044/1/acl2016.pdf">here</a> for a more detailed analysis of this issue. </p> 

	<blockquote>
		<p>Is the task easy for humans to do?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Even with clear instructions, some tasks are inherently subjective. It is unlikely that every person you ask will provide the same similarity score for <code>cat</code> and <code>dog</code>, or will interpret a written sarcastic comment the same way out of context. If humans cannot agree what the right answer is for a given input, how can a model ever do well? Of course, data scientists can take steps to address those issues. First, make sure that you have clear written annotator guidelines, even if you plan to do the annotation yourself. Ask others to read the guidelines and explain how they interpret your instructions.</p>
	<p>Second, do not be afraid to change the task to make it easier. If your use case allows it, make the task as simple as possible for the annotators. Ask yourself if it is business-critical to get fine-grained labels or if a coarser-grained (and therefore easier) annotation schema would suffice.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Do you have quality control in place?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Not having a mechanism for identifying annotator errors or consistently under-performing annotators is perhaps the most common error in data labeling. There are many viable ways to do quality control - the key is to ensure at least one of them is in use. A common approach is to measure if different annotators agree with one another or with a known gold-standard - see next case study. Conflicts may be resolved by an independent adjudicator.</p>
	<p>Ideally, quality control should be an automated process that runs continuously. Remember that systematic errors may be a sign of unclear guidelines. Talk to your annotators to understand the source of the problem. Be prepared to discard your first data set.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>How much data can you hope to get?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>A supervised learning model may require a significant amount of labeled data to perform well. However, obtaining this much data may be problematic for a number of reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Human annotators are expensive, even on crowd sourcing platforms that systematically underpay. </li>
		<li>Good, trustworthy annotators are hard to find, especially if they need special training.<ul>
			<li>An aside on ethics: pay fairly and treat annotators with respect at all times. The less you pay, the higher the odds you will have to repeat the job.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Errors in labeling may be hard to correct, so be prepared to discard data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep an eye on the learning curve of your model. Do not rush into gathering more data unless there is evidence to suggest it would help. It is often better to focus on quality rather than quantity. </p>
<h3 id="case-study-2-symptom-recognition-in-medical-data">Case study 2: symptom recognition in medical data</h3>
<p>The second case study involves identifying mentions of symptoms or diseases in notes taken by a doctor during routine exams. An indeal note may read: <code>Abdominal pain due to acute bacterial tonsilitis. No allergies</code>. However, these notes are often taken in a hurry and typically look more like this: </p>

<code>Abd pian//acute b tons//n/a alergies</code>. 

<p>
	This presents a different set of challenges for a data scientist.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Do you need an expert annotator?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Most doctors&#39; notes are impossible to decode for a layperson. Annotation therefore has to be done by a trained doctor, but most doctors prefer to practice medicine rather than label data. The typical doctor is also not an expert in machine learning or linguistics (and vice versa), so they may not have the same vocabulary. This makes it harder to provide a clear task definition.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Can you measure inter-annotator agreement?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Can you quantify the degree to which annotators agree? In the case of word similarity, this is as simple as comparing numerical scores. This gets trickier when the annotation unit has complex structure (e.g. it is a phrase). For example, in the sentence <code>burning neck pain </code> one annotator may pick up the first two words as a symptom, while another may pick up the last two words, and a third may not mark any symptoms. </p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Tooling</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Do you need specialist software to capture and store data? Depending on the complexity, can you write something yourself or do you have to assemble a team? Will the tool be intuitive and easy to use, or is it confusing your annotators? In our medical example, the tooling is getting much better and allows annotators to be very productive. Several years ago tools such as <a href="http://brat.nlplab.org">BRAT</a> were less mature and took a long time to set up, whereas now they run out of the box.</p> 

	<p>Further issues arise where hardware is involved (e.g. internet-of-things or industrial machines). These include writing bespoke software for the device to capture data, transmitting data to a server reliably and storing potentially massive amount of data that machines generate. </p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>People issues</p>
	</blockquote>
	<p>Many data science talks focus on the technical aspects of data gathering, with people issues often taking a back seat. However, a single well-trained and reliable annotator producing large amounts of labeled data can often contribute more to the success of a project than a team of programmers. It is therefore important to build and maintain a good working relationship with the annotators. This is much easier if they are located near you. Be prepared to deal with small issues such as
		annotators not showing up for sessions, or taking two-week breaks between sessions. The more time passes between sessions, the more the annotators will need re-training. This is the main reason why quality control should be run continuously.</p>
		<p>If you are using a crowd sourcing platform, beware of click farms. The academic literature has some fantastic resources on the subject.</p>
