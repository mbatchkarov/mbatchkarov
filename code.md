Most of my time is spend doing data science work in Python; I also use Java and Node.js. My preferred toolkit includes `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `gensim`, `spaCy`, `pytorch` and `tensorflow`. I've written Matlab and C in the past and occasionally write web-based front ends with Django/Flask, JavaScript (Angular, React), CSS and HTML. I keep meaning to learn R, Go and ML properly.

#### Open-source 

An outdated list of my open-source contributions, in order of proportion of code written by me:

 - [DiscoUtils](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/DiscoUtils), [dc_evaluation](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/dc_evaluation), [vector_builder](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/vector_builder) (2013-2015)- a collection of tools for working with distributional semantic models. I used this in my doctoral work.
 - [Critical difference](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/critical_difference) (2014)- a tool for visualising the results of multiple tests for statistical significance. See website for examples.
 - [word2vec-inversion](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/word2vec-inversion)- investigating a recent state-of-the-art document classification method using distributional semantic information
 - [Project Plovdiv](http://mbatchkarov.github.io/Plovdiv/) (from 2009)- a tool for teaching graph theory and mathematical epidemiology. I have been working on this on and off since 2009 (with help from Vladislav Donchev). The software is now reasonably stable and is being used in [Widening Participation](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/wp) events at the Department of Mathematics at Sussex.
 - [US address parser](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress) (2014)- a statistical parser for US addresses
 - [RCaller](https://code.google.com/p/rcaller/) (2011)- calling R code from Java
 - [DISSECT](https://github.com/composes-toolkit/dissect) (2014)- a toolkit for distributional compositional semantics. I ported it to Python 3 and simplified the code base a bit.
 - [qsutils](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/qsutils)- a script for processing the output of Sun Grid Engine's `qstat` command. Useful when running lots of grid jobs. Also lets you throttle jobs or move to a different queue.


#### Less known useful software others have written
- [Sikuli script](http://www.sikuli.org)- automatic UI actions
- [CRF Suite](http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/) and [Python bindings](https://github.com/tpeng/python-crfsuite)- a fast and well-documented implementation of conditional random fields
- [word2vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) and [GloVe](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)- fast and accurate neural word embeddings
- [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)- fast topic modelling in Python (contains a re-implementation of `word2vec`)
