#### Software I have contributed to (in order of proportion of code written by me)
 - [DiscoUtils](https://github.com/MLCL/DiscoUtils) (from 2013)- a small collection of tools for working with distributional semantic models. I use this in my doctoral work.
 - [Critical difference](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/critical_difference) (2014)- a tool for visualising the results of multiple tests for statistical significance. See website for examples.
 - [Project Plovdiv](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/Plovdiv) (from 2009)- a tool for teaching graph theory and mathematical epidemiology. I have been working on this on and off since 2009 (with help from Vladislav Donchev). The software is now reasonably stable and is being used in [Widening Participation](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/wp) events at the Department of Mathematics at Sussex.
 - [US address parser](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress) (2014)- a statistical parser for US addresses
 - [RCaller](https://code.google.com/p/rcaller/) (2011)- calling R code from Java
 - [DISSECT](https://github.com/composes-toolkit/dissect) (2014)- a toolkit for distributional compositional semantics. I ported it to Python 3 and simplified the code base a bit.

#### Less known usseful software others have written
- [Sikuli script](http://www.sikuli.org)- automatic UI actions
- [CRF Suite](http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/) and [Python bindings](https://github.com/tpeng/python-crfsuite)- a fast and well-documented implementation of conditional random fields
- [word2vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) and [GloVe](http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)- fast and accurate neural word embeddings
- [gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/)- fast topic modelling in Python (contains a re-implementation of `word2vec`)
